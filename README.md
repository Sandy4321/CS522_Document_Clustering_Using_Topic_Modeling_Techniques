# CS522_Document_Clustering_Using_Topic_Modeling_Techniques
Document clustering or text clustering is an application of cluster analysis to textual documents. Using this clustering mechanism and its different implementations we will focus on modelling topics and clustering the documents based on these topics. The main aim of this project is to provide an overview of some widely-used document clustering techniques. We will compare three different techniques viz. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Word2Vec and, analyze our results to learn which technique is better. For better analysis, we will be working over 2 datasets: Enron Email Dataset and Yelp Dataset, to carry out experiment on multiple different topics.
